# Spanish Vocabulary Quiz

A simple Python-based application to help you practice Spanish vocabulary. This project allows you to test your translation skills between Spanish and English.

## Features

- Load a dictionary of Spanish-English word pairs from a text file.
- Two quiz modes:
  1. **Spanish to English**: Translate Spanish words to English.
  2. **English to Spanish**: Translate English words to Spanish.
